# 02-spatial-filter

A Task for Image & Video Processing Course, comparing spatial convolution, lowpass spatial filter, lowpass with gaussian kernel, 1D highpass spatial filter, and 2D highpass spatial filter with and without OpenCV

## Feature

1. Measure time taken for each method to perform spatial convolution, lowpass spatial filter, lowpass with gaussian kernel, 1D highpass spatial filter, and 2D highpass spatial filter
2. Compare the result of each method
3. Compare the time taken for each method

## Prequisites

```
python3
opencv
numpy
```

## Program usage

<!-- [br-with-opencv.py](https://github.com/wannn-one/02-spatial-filter/blob/main/br-with-opencv.py) file : brightness change with OpenCV using cv2.addWeighted

[br-without-opencv.py](https://github.com/wannn-one/02-spatial-filter/blob/main/br-without-opencv.py) file : brightness change without OpenCV, perform manual thresholding with python built-in function

[co-with-opencv.py](https://github.com/wannn-one/02-spatial-filter/blob/main/co-with-opencv.py) file : contrast change with OpenCV using cv2.convertScaleAbs

[co-without-opencv.py](https://github.com/wannn-one/02-spatial-filter/blob/main/co-without-opencv.py) file : contrast change without OpenCV, perform manual iteration and clipping the edge with np.clip()  -->
